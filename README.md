code for a human-LLM hybrid content analysis of interview and field note data

# TLDR; 
This repository contains the code for a human-LLM hybrid content analysis of interview and field note data. It works similarly to a methodological template (e.g. Gioia methodology) for content analysis.
Once the pre-print is published a link to more explanation will be added. 
For now, consult the figure below for a quick explanation. The content of this repository covers the LLM-aided analysis, consult the rest of the figure for additional context.

Overview of data collection, LLM-aided analysis, validation, and continued engagement with the group. The researcher is indicated in blue, with central roles throughout the process (building trust, planning fieldwork, designing interview outlines, conducting the fieldwork, developing the codebook, selecting context for the analysis, adjusting the prompt in the LLM-analysis, conducting workshops after completion of the fieldwork and analysis, and validating outcomes with participants.
